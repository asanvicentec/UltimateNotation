# UltimateNotation
Convert notes to Solf√®ge representation on [Freetar](https://freetar.de/) site. This extension was originally meant to be used on the original Ultimate Guitar, but HTML is way harder to edit there, also Freetar removes a lot of UG bloat.

## Disclaimer
This extension has been tested, but it may not cover all use cases, if you happen to use it and find an error, please let me now.

# For developers
When viewing changes on-the-fly when developing, you can run `npm run start` and load the uncompressed extension 
by pointing to the dist folder in `chrome://extensions/`
